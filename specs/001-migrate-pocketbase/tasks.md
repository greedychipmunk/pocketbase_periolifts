# Tasks: Backend Migration from Appwrite to PocketBase

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-migrate-pocketbase/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Following PerioLifts Constitution Principle II (TDD), tests are MANDATORY and must be written BEFORE implementation. Tests are not optional - they are required for all features per constitutional requirements.

**Quality Gates**: All tasks must comply with Code Quality (Principle I) and Performance Requirements (Principle IV) from the constitution.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Flutter project**: `lib/`, `test/` at repository root
- **Models**: `lib/models/`
- **Services**: `lib/services/`  
- **Screens**: `lib/screens/`
- **Widgets**: `lib/widgets/`
- **Providers**: `lib/providers/`
- **Tests**: `test/unit/`, `test/widget/`, `test/integration/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and PocketBase SDK integration

- [x] T001 Add PocketBase Dart SDK dependency to pubspec.yaml
- [x] T002 [P] Create PocketBase configuration in lib/config/pocketbase_config.dart

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but may reference US1 auth
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD constitutional mandate)
- Models before services that use them
- Services before providers that wrap them
- Core implementation before screen integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for AuthService PocketBase integration in test/unit/services/auth_service_test.dart"
Task: "Widget test for LoginScreen with PocketBase auth in test/widget/screens/login_screen_test.dart"
Task: "Widget test for SignUpScreen with PocketBase auth in test/widget/screens/sign_up_screen_test.dart"
Task: "Integration test for complete auth flow in test/integration/auth_flow_test.dart"

# Launch model updates for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Update User model for PocketBase schema in lib/models/user.dart"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication Migration)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - users can now sign in with PocketBase

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP - Authentication works!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Core CRUD functionality)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full real-time features)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication Migration)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Data Service Migration)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Real-time Features Migration)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD mandate)
- Constitutional requirements: 90%+ test coverage, <100ms tracking response, <3s startup
- Remove ALL Appwrite references by completion
- Maintain identical UX throughout migration
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
