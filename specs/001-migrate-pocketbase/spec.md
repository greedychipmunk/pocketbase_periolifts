# Feature Specification: Backend Migration from Appwrite to PocketBase

**Feature Branch**: `001-migrate-pocketbase`  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Migrate the backend of this application from Appwrite to Pocketbase. Update all backend calls to Pocketbase. Remove any mention of Appwrite. Ensure that all features are functional"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Authentication Migration (Priority: P1)

Users must be able to sign in, sign up, and sign out using PocketBase authentication without any change in user experience. All existing user accounts should remain accessible after migration.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundation of the app - without it, users cannot access any features. This must work before any other functionality can be tested.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a test account, signing in, and accessing user-specific data, delivering immediate value of secure app access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing user with email/password, **When** they attempt to sign in, **Then** they should be successfully authenticated and redirected to dashboard
2. **Given** a new user, **When** they fill out the sign-up form with valid credentials, **Then** their account should be created and they should be automatically signed in
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they sign out, **Then** their session should be terminated and they should be redirected to login screen

### User Story 2 - Data Service Migration (Priority: P2)

All existing workout data operations (create, read, update, delete workouts, exercises, programs) must function identically through PocketBase APIs, maintaining data integrity during the migration.

**Why this priority**: Core app functionality depends on data operations. Users must be able to manage their workout data without interruption.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating, viewing, editing, and deleting workout data, ensuring all CRUD operations work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they create a new workout, **Then** it should be saved to PocketBase and appear in their workout list
2. **Given** existing workout data, **When** the user views their workout history, **Then** all historical data should be visible and accurate
3. **Given** a workout in progress, **When** the user updates exercise sets/reps, **Then** the changes should be persisted in real-time

---

### User Story 3 - Real-time Features Migration (Priority: P3)

Live workout tracking, session management, and progress synchronization must work seamlessly with PocketBase real-time capabilities, maintaining the responsive user experience during workouts.

**Why this priority**: Real-time features enhance the workout experience but the app is still functional without them. This can be implemented after core functionality is stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a workout session and verifying that progress updates are reflected immediately across the app interface.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active workout session, **When** the user completes a set, **Then** the progress should update immediately without manual refresh
2. **Given** multiple app instances, **When** data changes in one instance, **Then** other instances should reflect the changes in real-time
3. **Given** poor network connectivity, **When** the user tracks workouts offline, **Then** data should sync automatically when connectivity is restored

### Edge Cases

- What happens when PocketBase server is unreachable during workout tracking?
- How does the system handle authentication token expiration during long workout sessions?
- What occurs when migrating from Appwrite while users have active sessions?
- How does offline data sync handle conflicts when the same workout is modified on multiple devices?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate users via PocketBase email/password authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST migrate all existing data collections (workouts, exercises, programs, workout-sessions, workout-history) to PocketBase schema
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain identical API response formats to preserve existing UI functionality
- **FR-004**: System MUST support offline workout tracking with automatic sync when connectivity resumes
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement real-time data synchronization for workout progress updates
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve all existing user permissions and data access patterns
- **FR-007**: System MUST remove all Appwrite dependencies and references from the codebase
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain current database schema structure for seamless transition
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle authentication state changes and session management
- **FR-010**: System MUST support all current CRUD operations for workout data entities

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Authentication and profile data managed by PocketBase auth
- **Workout**: Exercise sessions with scheduling, completion status, and progress tracking
- **Exercise**: Individual exercise definitions with metadata and instructions
- **WorkoutPlan/Program**: Structured workout routines and scheduling templates
- **WorkoutSession**: Live tracking sessions with real-time progress updates
- **WorkoutHistory**: Historical data and analytics for progress monitoring

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All existing app features function identically after migration with 100% feature parity
- **SC-002**: Authentication flows complete in under 3 seconds on standard mobile connections
- **SC-003**: Workout data operations (CRUD) complete within 500ms response time
- **SC-004**: Real-time workout tracking updates reflect within 100ms of user input
- **SC-005**: Offline workout tracking supports sessions up to 2 hours without connectivity
- **SC-006**: Data migration completes without loss of any user workout history or progress data
- **SC-007**: App launch time remains under 3 seconds after backend migration
- **SC-008**: Zero Appwrite references remain in final codebase as confirmed by code analysis
