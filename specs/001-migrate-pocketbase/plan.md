# Implementation Plan: Backend Migration from Appwrite to PocketBase

**Branch**: `001-migrate-pocketbase` | **Date**: 2025-10-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-migrate-pocketbase/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Migrate the PerioLifts Flutter fitness tracking application from Appwrite backend to PocketBase, ensuring 100% feature parity with improved performance and maintainability. This involves replacing authentication, database operations, and real-time features while maintaining existing UI and user experience.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Dart 3.9.2, Flutter SDK (stable channel)  
**Primary Dependencies**: PocketBase Dart SDK, flutter_riverpod, provider, uuid, intl  
**Storage**: PocketBase SQLite with real-time subscriptions, local device storage for offline support  
**Testing**: flutter_test, mockito for unit tests, integration_test for widget/E2E testing  
**Target Platform**: iOS 15+, Android API 21+, cross-platform mobile application
**Project Type**: Flutter mobile app with PocketBase backend - single codebase, multi-platform  
**Performance Goals**: <100ms workout tracking response, <3s app startup, <500ms CRUD operations  
**Constraints**: <200MB memory usage during workouts, offline-first architecture, zero data loss tolerance  
**Scale/Scope**: Personal fitness app, 5 core collections, 20+ UI screens, real-time workout tracking

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Code Quality**: Feature design includes static analysis compliance plan (Dart analyzer with flutter_lints)
- [x] **Test-Driven Development**: TDD approach documented with test-first implementation strategy (all service migrations will have tests written first)
- [x] **User Experience**: UI components follow Material Design 3 and accessibility standards (no UI changes required, existing screens maintained)
- [x] **Performance**: Response time requirements (<100ms tracking, <3s startup) considered (PocketBase SDK optimized for mobile performance)
- [x] **Data Security**: Offline-first architecture and data validation strategy defined (PocketBase offline sync + client-side validation)

```

**Structure Decision**: Flutter mobile application with standard lib/ structure. All backend migration changes will occur in lib/services/ with corresponding model updates in lib/models/. UI layers remain unchanged to maintain user experience consistency.
